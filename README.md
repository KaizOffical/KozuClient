# Kozu Client
Kozu Client - Vietnamese Minecraft Client for 1.8.8 is very simple, easy to use and really helpful. Kozu helps you boost FPS (not really but yes) and lots of good features.

## Introduction
I don't know why but in a nice day, i have an idea about the name Kozu (a reason that it starts with 'K' that my name "Kaiz") <br>
Also, Kozu currently has loads of modules such as: KeyMod (Keystrokes), Block Overlay, Hit Overlay, TNT Timer, .... <br>
And Kozu is self-written source client, I just watched tutorials and followed and developed them. <br>
